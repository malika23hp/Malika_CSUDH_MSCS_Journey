In this repository, I document my academic journey through the Master of Science in Computer Science program at California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH), which I successfully completed in May 2025. This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of my coursework, assignments, projects, and personal growth during this period.

The Master's program at CSUDH offers a robust curriculum in computer science, covering areas such as software engineering, algorithms, machine learning, and database systems, with a strong focus on both theoretical foundations and practical applications.
